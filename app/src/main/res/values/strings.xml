    <string name="large_text">Python is an interpreted,\n high-level, general-purpose programming language\n. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.
        Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.
        Python was created in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum as a successor to the ABC programming language. Python 2.0, released in 2000, introduced features such as a new memory management system and support for Unicode. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible with Python 2.
        Python is widely used in many applications, including web development, software development, machine learning, data science, and artificial intelligence. It is also a popular language for teaching programming

        Here are some of the advantages of using Python:
        Easy to learn and use: Python has a simple syntax that is easy to learn, even for beginners.
        Versatile: Python can be used for a wide variety of tasks, including web development, software development, data science, and machine learning.
        Powerful: Python is a powerful language that can be used to create complex applications.
        Free and open source: Python is free and open source software, which means that it is freely available to use and distribute.
        Large community: Python has a large and active community of users and developers, which means that there are many resources available to help you learn and use the language.

    <string name="large_text_java">
        Java is a general-purpose, class-based, object-oriented programming language designed for having lesser implementation dependencies. It is a computing platform that allows application developers to write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.
        Java is a high-level language, meaning that its syntax is designed to be easy for humans to read and write. It is also a compiled language, meaning that Java code is converted into machine code before it can be executed.
        Java is one of the most popular programming languages in the world, and it is used to develop a wide variety of applications, including web applications, mobile applications, desktop applications, and enterprise software.
        Here are some of the key features of Java:
        Platform independent:
        Java programs can run on any platform that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This makes Java a very portable language, and it is one of the reasons why it is so popular for developing web applications.
        Object-oriented:
        Java is an object-oriented language, which means that it is based on the concept of objects. Objects are self-contained entities that contain data and code. This makes Java code very modular and reusable.
        Robust and secure:
        Java is a very robust and secure language. It has a number of features that make it difficult for programmers to make mistakes, and it also has a number of security features that make Java applications difficult to hack.
        Multithreaded:
        Java supports multithreading, which means that Java programs can run multiple tasks at the same time. This makes Java a very efficient language for developing applications that need to handle a lot of concurrent requests.
        Distributed:
        Java is a distributed language, which means that Java programs can be distributed across multiple computers. This makes Java a very good language for developing large-scale applications.
        Java is a powerful and versatile language that can be used to develop a wide variety of applications. It is a good choice for both beginners and experienced programmers.
